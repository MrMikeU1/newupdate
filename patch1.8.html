          <div id="patchnotes">Fixed an issue where, when dragging items from a loot crate or the field, players couldn’t acquire items because the item amounts were automatically divided
          Fixed an issue where, when the backpack was full, players couldn’t throw away extended mags
          Fixed an issue where the camera would rotate 180 degrees upon death, making it difficult to understand which direction you were killed from.
          Fixed an issue allowing players to see through some buildings on Sanhok
          The crossbow zeroing will always remain at 25m even with a scope attached.
